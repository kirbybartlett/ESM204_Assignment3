```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
#Pb = crolling * m *g*V + 1/2 A*pair*cdrag*V3 is the equation - I don't think this equation works though

autopower = function (v, m, a, crolling = 0.015, cdrag = 0.3, g = 9.8, pair= 1.2) {
  P = (crolling * m * g* v) + (.5*a *pair * cdrag * (v**3)                                                         return(P)}
  
autopower(mass = 31752, speed = 30, area = 2.5)

#Answer should be 152176.3  



```

# Assignment 3:
## what if we design new highways that have lower rolling coefficients 
## we can reduce the rolling coefficient by 50%
## or we can reduce the mean speed to 80 km/h (still with 10% standard deviation)
## calculate mean power for both (assuming the same car probabilities above)
## which is better
