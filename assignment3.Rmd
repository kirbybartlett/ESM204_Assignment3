```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

whale_data <- read_csv("HW3Data.csv")

```


binomial linear regression for part 1
```{r}
model_pt1 <- lm(vote ~ age + income + NEP + risk + bid, data = whale_data, family = "linear")

summary(model_pt1)

summary(model_pt1)

```
Part 2:


Use 60% as your risk and know that that saves 15 whales. Solve. 
Have vote as 1 and solve for bid. Then divide by 15 to get value of 1 whale

Part 3:
Pick three people and put in their info and solve for vote. Then set vote to 1 and solve for bid. 

Part 4:
Would you take the average of all parameters and plug that in to solve for vote, then set vote to 1 and solve for bid?

Part 5:
Multiply average by 150,000
